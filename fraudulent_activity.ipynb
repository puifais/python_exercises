    "HackerLand National Bank has a simple policy for warning clients about possible fraudulent account activity. If the amount spent by a client on a particular day is greater than or equal to  the client's median spending for the last  days, they send the client a notification about potential fraud. The bank doesn't send the client any notifications until they have at least  prior days of transaction data.\n",
